      "At this point the concepts of a *program* and a *programming language* should be clear. Throughout this course and for the rest of your career, you will frequently be creating programs that use a simple set of instructions to do complex tasks. You will find that all programming languages all have in common sets of instructions that fall into these three classifications:\n",

      "1. Arithematic - instructions for programming mathematical expressions.\n",
      "2. Iterators - instructions for repeating a subroutine (\"sub-program\").\n",
